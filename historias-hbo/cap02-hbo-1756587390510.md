FADE IN:

The summer sun blazed over Wrightsville Beach as Ethan Bennett made his way across the warm sand, his blue surfboard tucked under his arm. The morning light painted long shadows across the shoreline when he spotted Joann Adams adjusting her wetsuit near the water's edge.

The ocean breeze carried the salt spray as seagulls circled overhead, their calls mixing with the rhythmic sound of breaking waves. The scene had all the makings of a perfect North Carolina surf day.

FADE OUT.
