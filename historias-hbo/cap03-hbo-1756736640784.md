FADE IN:

INT. WILMINGTON APARTMENT - KITCHEN - EARLY MORNING

The steady drip of a coffee maker punctuates the quiet morning. SARAH (49), a clinical psychologist, stands in her robe and slippers, watching the dark liquid pool in the carafe. The October sunrise struggles through heavy clouds, casting unusual shadows across her granite countertop.

The kitchen window offers a partial view of the Cape Fear River, its waters gray under the moody sky. Sarah stirs her coffee absently, a growing unease settling in her chest.

SARAH (V.O.)
Something feels off this morning. Different. Like when you know a storm's coming before the first drop falls.

She glances down the hallway toward the bedroom where JAMES still sleeps. The apartment's silence feels heavy, almost tangible.

SARAH (V.O.)
Twenty years of listening to other people's troubles as a therapist, and somehow I never got better at dealing with my own premonitions.

She takes a sip of coffee, her wedding ring clinking against the ceramic mug. Through the window, a flock of seagulls wheels against the clouded sky.

FADE OUT.
