FADE IN:

The summer sun blazes over Wrightsville Beach, casting long shadows across the pristine North Carolina shoreline. Ethan Bennett walks across the sand, his blue surfboard tucked under his arm, salt air filling his lungs. The morning light catches the water droplets on his board, creating tiny prisms.

He spots Joann Adams by the shoreline, adjusting the zipper of her sleek black wetsuit. Her fingers work methodically as the ocean breeze tousles her hair. The waves crash rhythmically behind them, a perfect morning for surfing.

FADE OUT.
