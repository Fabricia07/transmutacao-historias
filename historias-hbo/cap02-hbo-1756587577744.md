FADE IN:

The summer sun blazed over Wrightsville Beach as Ethan Bennett made his way across the warm sand, his blue surfboard tucked under his arm. The morning light painted long shadows across the beach when he spotted Joann Adams adjusting her wetsuit near the shoreline.

The ocean stretched endlessly before them, its waves rolling in with a rhythmic persistence that called to both surfers. Joann's wetsuit zipper caught the sunlight as she finished preparing for their session, while Ethan's board reflected the deep Carolina blue sky above.

FADE OUT.
