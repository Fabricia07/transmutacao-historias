FADE IN:

The summer sun blazed over Wrightsville Beach as Ethan Bennett made his way across the warm sand, his blue surfboard tucked under his arm. In the distance, he spotted Joann Adams adjusting the zipper of her wetsuit, her silhouette sharp against the morning glare.

The ocean stretched before them like liquid crystal, promising perfect waves on this North Carolina morning. The salt-laden breeze carried the familiar scent of sunscreen and sea spray, while distant seagulls circled overhead.

FADE OUT.
