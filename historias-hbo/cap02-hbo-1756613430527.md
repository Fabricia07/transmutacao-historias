FADE IN:

The summer sun blazed over Wrightsville Beach as Ethan Bennett made his way across the warm sand, his blue surfboard tucked under his arm. In the distance, he spotted Joann Adams adjusting the zipper of her wetsuit, her silhouette backlit by the morning light.

The Atlantic waves crashed rhythmically against the shore, creating that distinct East Coast rumble that drew surfers from across North Carolina. Salt spray hung in the air as seagulls circled overhead, their calls echoing across the beach.

The morning light caught the droplets of water on Joann's wetsuit as she turned to wave at Ethan, her blonde hair catching the coastal breeze.

FADE OUT.
