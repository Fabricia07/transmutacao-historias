FADE IN:

INT. WILMINGTON APARTMENT - KITCHEN - MORNING

Coffee drips steadily in the maker, a rhythm that usually brings comfort to SARAH (49), a clinical psychologist still in her nightgown and slippers. The morning light filters through the window, typical for a September day in coastal Carolina, casting unusual shadows across her granite countertop.

The Port City's signature oak trees sway outside, their branches creating dancing patterns on the kitchen floor. A heavy stillness hangs in the air, broken only by the methodical drip of coffee.

Sarah stirs Splenda into her mug, her movements mechanical. Something feels off this Friday morning - maybe it's the approaching hurricane season, or perhaps something deeper.

Her husband DAVID sleeps in their bedroom down the hall. Twenty years of practicing psychology has taught her to trust these gut feelings, these moments when the ordinary suddenly feels extraordinary.

Through the window, the Cape Fear River gleams in the distance, partially obscured by gathering storm clouds.

SARAH (V.O.)
(soft, contemplative)
Twenty years of helping others navigate their inner storms, yet some mornings, the shadows still catch me off guard.

She stands motionless, watching the coffee drip, listening to the weighted silence of their Market Street apartment.

FADE OUT.
