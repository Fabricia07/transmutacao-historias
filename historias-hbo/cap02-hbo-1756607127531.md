FADE IN:

The summer sun blazed over Wrightsville Beach as Ethan Bennett made his way across the warm sand, his blue surfboard tucked under his arm. In the distance, he spotted Joann Adams adjusting the zipper of her wetsuit, her silhouette framed by the morning light.

The waves crashed rhythmically against the shore, creating a hypnotic backdrop to their morning ritual. The salty breeze carried the promise of perfect sets rolling in from the Atlantic.

FADE OUT.
