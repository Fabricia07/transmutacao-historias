FADE IN:

The summer sun blazed over Wrightsville Beach as Ethan Bennett made his way across the warm sand, his blue surfboard tucked under his arm. The morning light painted long shadows across the beach when he spotted Joann Adams adjusting her wetsuit near the shoreline.

The Atlantic waves crashed rhythmically against the shore, creating a perfect backdrop for their morning session. Salt spray hung in the air as seagulls circled overhead, their calls echoing across the beach.

FADE OUT.
