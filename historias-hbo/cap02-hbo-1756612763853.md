FADE IN:

The summer sun blazed over Wrightsville Beach as Ethan Bennett made his way across the warm sand, his blue surfboard tucked under his arm. The morning light danced off the Atlantic waves when he spotted Joann Adams adjusting her wetsuit near the shoreline.

The scene felt like a postcard moment: seagulls circling overhead, the salty breeze carrying whispers of adventure, and two souls drawn to the ocean's call.

FADE OUT.
