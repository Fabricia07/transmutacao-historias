FADE IN:

The summer sun blazed over Wrightsville Beach as Ethan Bennett made his way across the warm sand, his blue surfboard tucked under his arm. In the distance, he spotted Joann Adams adjusting her wetsuit, her silhouette backlit by the morning light.

The ocean swells rolled in rhythmically against the North Carolina shore, promising perfect conditions for what lay ahead. Joann's wetsuit zipper caught the sunlight as she finished preparing for their session.

The familiar scent of salt water and sunscreen filled the air as the two surfers exchanged knowing glances, ready to take on the Atlantic waves.

FADE OUT.
