FADE IN:

INT. WILMINGTON APARTMENT - KITCHEN - MORNING

The first light of a September dawn filters through the kitchen window, partially obscured by storm clouds rolling in from the Atlantic. The drip coffee maker hisses and sputters with its familiar morning rhythm, but something about the cadence feels off today.

SARAH (V.O.)
(soft, contemplative)
There's always been something comforting about this morning ritual. Until today.

SARAH MATTHEWS (49), wearing a faded UNC Wilmington sweatshirt and slippers, stands at the granite counter, stirring sweetener into her coffee. She's professional, put-together even in her morning state, the kind of woman who's spent years listening to others' problems.

Through the window, Spanish moss sways on the live oaks lining Market Street. The air feels heavy, pregnant with an approaching coastal storm.

SARAH (V.O.)
Twenty years as a clinical psychologist, and I still can't shake this feeling. Something's different.

Down the hallway, MICHAEL (51) sleeps soundly in their bedroom. The apartment holds an unsettling quiet, broken only by the persistent drip of the coffee maker and distant foghorns from the Cape Fear River.

Sarah's hand pauses mid-stir, her attention caught by something indefinable, a shadow of unease crossing her face.

FADE OUT.
