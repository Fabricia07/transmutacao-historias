FADE IN:

The summer sun blazes over Wrightsville Beach, casting long shadows across the pristine North Carolina shoreline. Ethan Bennett walks across the sand, his blue surfboard tucked under his arm, the salt air filling his lungs. The morning light catches the water beading off his board's polished surface.

He spots Joann Adams near the waterline, adjusting the zipper of her sleek black wetsuit with practiced precision. Their eyes meet, sharing that unspoken understanding that comes from years of chasing waves together.

FADE OUT.
