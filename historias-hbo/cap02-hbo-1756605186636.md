FADE IN:

The summer sun blazes over Wrightsville Beach's pristine shoreline. Ethan Bennett walks across the warm sand, his blue surfboard tucked under his arm, casting long shadows in the early morning light. The salty breeze carries the rhythmic sound of breaking waves.

Near the waterline, Joann Adams adjusts the zipper of her wetsuit, her fingers working methodically as she prepares for the session ahead. Their eyes meet, sharing that unspoken understanding only surfers know.

The ocean stretches before them like liquid gold, promising perfect sets rolling in from the Atlantic.

FADE OUT.
