FADE IN:

The morning sun casts long shadows across Wrightsville Beach as Ethan Bennett waxes his surfboard, his eyes fixed on the perfect sets rolling in. Next to him, Joann Adams adjusts her wetsuit, her blonde hair catching the golden light of dawn.

The water sparkles like diamonds as they paddle out beyond the break, their silhouettes cutting through the mist that hovers above the Atlantic. The air tastes of salt and possibility.

"This swell's looking epic," Ethan calls out, his voice carrying over the rhythmic crash of waves.

They wait patiently, bobbing in the lineup, until the perfect wave approaches. Joann catches it first, gracefully popping up and carving through the face of the wave, while Ethan watches, mesmerized by her fluid movements.

Later, as the sun climbs higher, they sit on their boards, sharing a moment of peaceful silence, their bodies tired but spirits soaring. The North Carolina coastline stretches endlessly behind them, a backdrop to their perfect morning.

FADE OUT.
