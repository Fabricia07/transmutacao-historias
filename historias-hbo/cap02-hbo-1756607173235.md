FADE IN:

The summer sun blazed over Wrightsville Beach as Ethan Bennett made his way across the warm sand, his blue surfboard tucked under his arm. He spotted Joann Adams near the shoreline, adjusting the zipper of her wetsuit with practiced precision.

The morning light danced off the Atlantic waves, creating a cinematic shimmer that stretched to the horizon. Palm trees swayed gently in the coastal breeze, their shadows playing across the sand like nature's sundial.

FADE OUT.
