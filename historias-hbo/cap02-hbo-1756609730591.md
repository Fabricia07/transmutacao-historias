FADE IN:

The summer sun blazed over Wrightsville Beach as Ethan Bennett made his way across the warm sand, his blue surfboard tucked under his arm. The morning light painted long shadows across the shoreline when he spotted Joann Adams adjusting her wetsuit near the water's edge.

The ocean breeze tousled their hair as they exchanged knowing glances, seasoned surfers reading the perfect waves rolling in. Their silhouettes cut dramatic figures against the golden morning light, like a scene crafted for the silver screen.

FADE OUT.
