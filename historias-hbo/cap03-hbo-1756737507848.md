FADE IN:

INT. WILMINGTON APARTMENT - KITCHEN - EARLY MORNING

The soft DRIP of a coffee maker echoes through a modest kitchen overlooking the Cape Fear River. Gray October clouds cast a melancholic filter through the window.

SARAH (V.O.)
(soft, contemplative)
Some mornings just feel... different.

SARAH MATTHEWS (49), in a well-worn robe and slippers, stands at the granite counter, stirring sugar into her coffee. Her movements are mechanical, distracted. The kitchen shows signs of a comfortable routine - two matching mugs, a worn coffee maker, morning light catching the steam.

Through the window, Spanish moss sways from live oaks, creating shifting shadows across the counter.

SARAH (V.O.)
Twenty years as a clinical psychologist 
teaches you to trust your instincts. 
This morning, something's off.

She glances down the hallway where DAVID (51) still sleeps. The apartment holds an unusual stillness, broken only by the rhythmic dripping of coffee and distant seagulls.

Sarah wraps her hands around her mug, but doesn't drink. Her face reflects unease as she stares at the churning clouds over the river.

FADE OUT.
