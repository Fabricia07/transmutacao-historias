FADE IN:

The summer sun blazed over Wrightsville Beach as Ethan Bennett made his way across the warm sand, his blue surfboard tucked under his arm. In the distance, he spotted Joann Adams adjusting the zipper of her wetsuit, her silhouette backlit by the morning light.

The waves crashed rhythmically against the shore, creating a symphony that every surfer knew by heart. Salt air filled their lungs as they exchanged knowing glances â€“ it was going to be a perfect day to catch some waves.

FADE OUT.
