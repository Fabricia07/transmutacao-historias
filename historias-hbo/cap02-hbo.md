FADE IN:

The summer sun blazes over Wrightsville Beach, casting long shadows across the pristine North Carolina shoreline. Ethan Bennett walks across the sand, his blue surfboard tucked under his arm, the salt air filling his lungs with each step.

In the distance, he spots Joann Adams adjusting the zipper of her wetsuit, her silhouette backlit by the morning light. Their eyes meet, and a knowing smile passes between them â€“ another perfect day to catch waves.

FADE OUT.
