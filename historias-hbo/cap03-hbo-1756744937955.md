Coffee dripped from the maker with that familiar sound that always marked the beginning of our days, but something about the rhythm of those drops left me unsettled that Friday morning. March light filtered through the kitchen window of our Historic Downtown home, partially obscured by gray clouds, casting strange shadows across the counter where I usually prepared breakfast for both of us. I stirred sugar into my Port City Java blend, feeling an unease crawling like a shadow in my chest. Ethan was still asleep upstairs in our Dock Street townhouse, and I stood there in my nightgown and slippers, listening to the heavy silence of our home. My name is Maggie Bennett. I am forty-nine, a clinical therapist at Coastal Wellness for over twenty years.

The coastal mist was drifting up from the Cape Fear River, as it often did on spring mornings like this. From our kitchen window at 847 Dock Street, I could just make out the silhouette of the Riverwalk through the fog. A gull called somewhere in the distance, its cry carrying across the water and mingling with the steady drip of coffee.

I wrapped my hands around the warm mug, seeking comfort in its familiar weight. The morning felt wrong somehow, off-kilter in a way I could not name. Perhaps it was the weather - March in Wilmington could be unpredictable, bringing both azalea blooms and storm clouds within the same week. Or perhaps it was something deeper, an intuition I had learned not to ignore after decades of clinical practice.

The hardwood floors creaked beneath my feet as I moved to the window. Our townhouse had become a sanctuary over the years, its historic bones holding countless memories. The morning light caught the collection of framed photos on our wall - moments frozen in time. Ethan at Wrightsville Beach, his contagious smile bright as the summer sun. The two of us at Sullivan Engineering's holiday party, his arm protectively around my shoulders. His graduation from UNCW, standing proud between his mentor Gavin and his close friend Julian.

The leather bracelet with his initials - E.B. - lay on the counter where he had left it the night before. He never took it off except to shower, telling me it reminded him of home, of us, of everything that mattered. I ran my finger across the worn leather, remembering the day I gave it to him, how his blue eyes had lit up with childlike joy.

A car horn sounded somewhere down Market Street, startling me from my reverie. The coffee had stopped dripping, its aroma filling our kitchen with promises of normalcy. But that shadow of unease remained, settling deeper into my bones as I stood alone in our quiet home, waiting for Ethan to wake up and start another day at Sullivan Engineering.

The azaleas were just beginning to bloom in our small courtyard garden, their pink and white petals a defiant burst of color against the gray morning. Soon the whole city would explode into color for the North Carolina Azalea Festival, transforming Historic Downtown into a celebration of spring. Ethan loved this time of year, when the coastal chill finally gave way to warmth, and the whole community seemed to emerge from winter hibernation.

I thought about my first appointment of the day at the clinic on Front Street, wondering if I should wake him soon. He had been working late recently, collaborating with Julian on a sustainable design project that had captured his passion. Last night he had come home excited, talking about innovative solutions for coastal resilience while we shared takeout from The George on the Riverwalk.

The silence stretched on, broken only by the distant sound of the morning Wave Transit bus making its way down Market Street. Something pulled at me, an invisible thread of worry I could not quite grasp. I set my coffee down, the porcelain cup making a soft click against the granite counter, and moved toward the stairs...
