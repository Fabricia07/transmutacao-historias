FADE IN:

INT. WILMINGTON APARTMENT - KITCHEN - EARLY MORNING

Coffee drips steadily in the maker, a familiar sound that usually marks the start of another coastal morning. But today, something feels off about its rhythm.

September sunlight filters through the kitchen window, partially blocked by storm clouds rolling in from the Atlantic, casting unusual shadows across the granite countertop where SARAH (49) stands in her nightgown and slippers.

She stirs Splenda into her coffee mug, an uneasy feeling creeping through her chest. The only sounds are the coffee maker and distant seagulls.

SARAH (V.O.)
I'm a clinical psychologist. Twenty years helping others navigate their lives, yet something about this morning feels... different.

Through the doorway, we glimpse her husband DAVID still asleep in their bedroom. Sarah remains frozen in place, watching the shadows dance across her counter as a cargo ship's horn echoes faintly from the Cape Fear River.

FADE OUT.

[Note: The adaptation maintains the core emotional elements while shifting the setting to coastal North Carolina, incorporating local elements like the river, seagulls, and approaching storms common to Wilmington.]
