FADE IN:

INT. WILMINGTON APARTMENT - KITCHEN - EARLY MORNING

Coffee drips steadily in the coffee maker, a familiar sound that usually brings comfort to SARAH (49), a clinical psychologist in a worn bathrobe and slippers. She stands motionless at her granite countertop, watching the dark liquid fill the pot.

Through the kitchen window, the early September sun struggles against heavy storm clouds rolling in from the coast, casting unusual shadows across the breakfast nook where two place settings wait empty.

Sarah stirs Sugar into her coffee, her movements mechanical. Something feels off - maybe it's the approaching hurricane season, or maybe it's something else entirely.

The apartment sits in heavy silence, broken only by the soft DRIP of coffee and distant WAVES from the nearby Cape Fear River. Down the hallway, MARK still sleeps soundly.

SARAH (V.O.)
Twenty years of helping others navigate their inner storms, yet this morning's unease feels different. Like the calm before a hurricane we all know is coming.

She takes a sip of coffee, her eyes fixed on the growing darkness outside.

FADE OUT.
