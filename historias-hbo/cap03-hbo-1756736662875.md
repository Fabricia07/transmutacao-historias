FADE IN:

INT. WILMINGTON APARTMENT - KITCHEN - MORNING

The old drip coffee maker sputters and hisses, its familiar morning rhythm slightly off-beat today. Through the kitchen window, October's pale light filters in past heavy storm clouds rolling in from the Atlantic, casting unusual shadows across the granite countertop.

SARAH (V.O.)
(soft Southern accent)
Something felt different that morning.

SARAH MITCHELL (49), wearing a faded UNC-W t-shirt and slippers, stirs her coffee methodically. Her movements are precise, practiced - the routine of someone who's done this thousands of times before.

The apartment is silent except for the gentle whir of the ceiling fan and distant seagulls. Down the hallway, gentle snoring drifts from the bedroom where THOMAS still sleeps.

SARAH (V.O.)
I'm a clinical psychologist. Twenty 
years helping others navigate their 
anxieties. But that morning, standing 
in my kitchen off Market Street, 
something dark and restless stirred 
in my own chest.

She pauses mid-stir, looking out toward the Cape Fear River, barely visible through the morning haze.
