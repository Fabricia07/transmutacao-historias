FADE IN:

The summer sun blazed over Wrightsville Beach as Ethan Bennett made his way across the warm sand, his blue surfboard tucked under his arm. In the distance, he spotted Joann Adams adjusting the zipper of her wetsuit, her silhouette backlit by the morning light.

The Atlantic waves rolled in with perfect sets, promising an epic session ahead. A light offshore breeze carried the distinct smell of salt and sunscreen through the air as the two surfers met near the shoreline.

FADE OUT.
