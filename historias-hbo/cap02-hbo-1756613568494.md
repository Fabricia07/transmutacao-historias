FADE IN:

The summer sun blazes over Wrightsville Beach, casting long shadows across the pristine North Carolina shoreline. Ethan Bennett strides through the sand, his blue surfboard tucked under his arm, salt air whipping through his hair. The morning light catches the ocean spray, creating a ethereal mist over the breaking waves.

He spots Joann Adams near the waterline, adjusting the zipper of her black wetsuit with practiced precision. Their silhouettes stand in sharp contrast against the golden morning light, two figures drawn together by the call of the Atlantic.

FADE OUT.
