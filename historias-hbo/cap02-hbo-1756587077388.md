FADE IN:

The summer sun blazes over Wrightsville Beach, casting long shadows across the pristine North Carolina shoreline. Ethan Bennett strides across the sand, his blue surfboard tucked under his arm, salt air filling his lungs with each step. The morning light catches the ocean spray, creating a ethereal mist over the breaking waves.

He spots Joann Adams near the waterline, adjusting her wetsuit with practiced precision. Her fingers work the zipper as she glances up, offering a knowing smile. The early morning crowd is sparse, leaving them with an almost private slice of the Atlantic.

FADE OUT.
