FADE IN:

The morning sun blazes over Wrightsville Beach, casting long shadows across the pristine North Carolina coastline. Ethan Bennett walks along the shoreline, his blue surfboard tucked under his arm, the salt air filling his lungs with each step.

In the distance, he spots Joann Adams adjusting her wetsuit near the pier, her blonde hair catching the golden light. The Atlantic waves crash rhythmically against the shore as they meet, exchanging knowing glances that only surfers share.

FADE OUT.
