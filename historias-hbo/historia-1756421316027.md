FADE IN:

The morning sun casts long shadows across Wrightsville Beach as Ethan Bennett waxes his longboard, salt air filling his lungs. He glances at Joann Adams, who's stretching nearby, her wetsuit catching the golden light of dawn. The North Carolina coast sprawls before them, waves rolling in with mechanical precision.

"Water's perfect today," Joann calls out, her board tucked under her arm as she walks toward the shoreline. Ethan follows, feeling the cool sand between his toes.

They paddle out past the break, sitting on their boards as the Atlantic swells rise and fall beneath them. The beach town is just waking up behind them, but here, in this moment, it's just them and the ocean.

When the right wave comes, they catch it together, their silhouettes carved against the morning light as they glide across the face of the wave, water spraying in their wake.

FADE OUT.
