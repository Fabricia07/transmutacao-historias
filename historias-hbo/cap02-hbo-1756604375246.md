FADE IN:

The summer sun blazes over Wrightsville Beach as ocean waves crash rhythmically against the shore. Ethan Bennett walks across the warm sand, his blue surfboard tucked under his arm, salt air filling his lungs. He spots Joann Adams near the waterline, adjusting the zipper of her sleek wetsuit with practiced precision.

The morning light catches the water droplets on the surface of their boards, creating tiny prisms that dance in the coastal Carolina air. The beach is still quiet, save for the distant calls of seagulls and the gentle whoosh of breaking waves.

FADE OUT.
