FADE IN:

The summer sun blazed over Wrightsville Beach, casting long shadows across the pristine North Carolina shoreline. Ethan Bennett walked across the warm sand, his blue surfboard tucked under his arm, the salt air filling his lungs with each step.

In the distance, he spotted Joann Adams adjusting the zipper of her wetsuit, her blonde hair catching the early morning light. Their eyes met, sharing that unspoken understanding that only surfers know - it was going to be a perfect day.

FADE OUT.
