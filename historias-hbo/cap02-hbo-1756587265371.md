FADE IN:

The summer sun blazed over Wrightsville Beach as Ethan Bennett made his way across the warm sand, his blue surfboard tucked under his arm. In the distance, he spotted Joann Adams adjusting her wetsuit, her silhouette contrasting against the morning haze.

The waves crashed rhythmically against the shore, creating a hypnotic backdrop to their meeting. Seagulls circled overhead as the Atlantic's salty breeze swept through the dunes.

FADE OUT.
