FADE IN:

The summer sun blazes over Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina, casting long shadows across the pristine shoreline. Ethan Bennett makes his way through the morning crowd, his blue surfboard tucked under his arm, the salt air clinging to his skin.

Through the golden haze, he spots Joann Adams adjusting the zipper of her wetsuit, her silhouette backlit by the rising sun. The Atlantic waves crash rhythmically behind them, promising a perfect session ahead.

FADE OUT.
