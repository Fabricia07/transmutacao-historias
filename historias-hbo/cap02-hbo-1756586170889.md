FADE IN:

The summer sun blazes over Wrightsville Beach as Ethan Bennett walks across the warm sand, his blue surfboard tucked under his arm. In the distance, he spots Joann Adams adjusting her wetsuit, her fingers working methodically over the zipper.

The morning light creates long shadows across the pristine shoreline as they meet, the Atlantic waves crashing rhythmically behind them. Joann's wetsuit glistens with tiny droplets of sea spray while Ethan's board reflects the intense morning glare.

FADE OUT.
