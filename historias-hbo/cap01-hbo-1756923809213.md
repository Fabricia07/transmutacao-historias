Coffee dripped into the pot with that familiar sound that always marked the beginning of our days, but something about the rhythm of those drops left me unsettled that Friday morning. March light filtered through the kitchen window of our Dock Street home, partially obscured by gray clouds, casting strange shadows across the counter where I always prepared breakfast for us both. I stirred sugar into my cup when I felt an unease crawling like a shadow in my chest - a silent warning with no name or logical explanation.

Ethan was still sleeping, and I stood there in my nightgown and slippers, listening to the heavy silence of our apartment. The distant sound of early morning traffic on Market Street barely registered. I took a deep breath trying to shake off that silly feeling, but my hand trembled slightly while placing French bread in the toaster. It was just another ordinary Friday, I told myself. Ethan would leave for work as always, return in the evening complaining about traffic on Third Street. That's what I kept repeating, even knowing a mother's heart rarely errs when it whispers something isn't right.

I'm Maggie. Forty-nine years old, clinical therapist at Coastal Wellness for over twenty years. That morning, preparing our coffee as I had done every day for twenty-one years, I couldn't imagine some routines are destined to break forever.

Ethan appeared in the hallway at seven fifteen, hair tousled, still in his pajamas, rubbing his eyes like he'd done since childhood. Even at twenty-five, an architect at Sullivan Engineering, he still had that boyish way of waking up that melted my heart. He mumbled good morning, heading straight for the refrigerator in search of orange juice.

I commented on the gloomy day. He glanced out the window, analyzing the heavy sky. When I mentioned rain, he assured me it would clear up, pouring juice into a tall glass. Ethan carried a sweetness that hurt in its purity. At seven, when I'd come home exhausted from the clinic, he'd already set my slippers by the bed and left a glass of water on the nightstand - small gestures revealing an immense heart. Now a grown man, he still kept that caring essence, asking daily if I'd taken my medicine.

I suggested he take a rideshare service today. He sighed with that patient tone while buttering his bread. The famous motorcycle. Ethan had bought that black Ninja like someone buying a realized dream. For him, it meant freedom, the feeling he could go anywhere, be anything. For me, it was a constant source of worry disguised as maternal pride.

He finished breakfast, came to kiss my head. I breathed in his scent - fennel shampoo, subtle cologne, that homey smell that had reassured me for over two decades. I told him to be careful, as I did every day. He promised to drive slowly and let me know when he arrived, telling me he loved me.

I love you too, I said. If I'd known that would be our last morning I love you, I would have held that moment longer. Would have better recorded the sound of his laughter echoing down the hall when he tripped on his own foot trying to put on his sock. Would have paid more attention to how he hung his key on the hook before leaving.
