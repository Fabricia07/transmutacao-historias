FADE IN:

The coffee dripped steadily in the maker with that familiar sound that always marked the beginning of our days, but something about the rhythm of the drops that Friday morning left me unsettled. March light filtered through the kitchen window, partially obscured by gray clouds, casting strange shadows across the counter where I always prepared breakfast for us both. As I stirred sugar into my cup, I felt an uneasiness crawling like a shadow deep in my chest. Ethan was still asleep, and I stood there in my nightgown and slippers, listening to the heavy silence of our beachfront apartment.

My name is Marcia. I'm forty-nine, a clinical psychologist for over twenty years. The salt air from Wrightsville Beach drifted through the slightly open window, mixing with the coffee aroma in a way that usually brought comfort but today felt somehow different, almost ominous.

FADE OUT.
