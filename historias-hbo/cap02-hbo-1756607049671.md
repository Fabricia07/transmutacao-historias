FADE IN:

The morning sun blazes over Wrightsville Beach, casting long shadows across the pristine North Carolina shoreline. Ethan Bennett strides through the sand, his blue surfboard tucked under his arm, the salt air clinging to his skin. 

The beach is coming alive as he spots Joann Adams adjusting her wetsuit near the water's edge. Her fingers work methodically at the zipper while the Atlantic waves crash rhythmically behind her.

Their silhouettes merge against the golden morning light as they exchange knowing glances - another perfect day to catch waves.

FADE OUT.
