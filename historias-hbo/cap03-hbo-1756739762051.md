FADE IN:

INT. WILMINGTON APARTMENT - KITCHEN - MORNING

The soft drip of the coffee maker marks another dawn in this coastal town. SARAH (49), a clinical psychologist, stands in her robe and slippers, watching the machine with unusual unease. The October morning light filters through her kitchen window, partially blocked by storm clouds rolling in from the Atlantic.

The shadows cast across her granite countertop seem different today, more ominous than their usual dance across the space where she prepares breakfast for two each morning.

Sarah stirs her coffee, the spoon clinking against ceramic as thunder rumbles in the distance. Something feels off - a heaviness in her chest she can't quite name.

SARAH (V.O.)
Twenty years of helping others understand their anxieties, and here I am, unsettled by the rhythm of my own morning routine.

Through the hallway, the sound of JAMES sleeping peacefully in their bedroom only amplifies the strange silence filling their apartment near Wrightsville Beach.

Sarah takes another sip, her eyes drawn to the darkening sky over the Cape Fear River.

FADE OUT.
