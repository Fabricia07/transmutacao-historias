The coffee dripped steadily into the pot with that familiar sound that always marked the start of our days, but something about the rhythm of those drops left me uneasy that Friday morning. March light filtered through the kitchen window of our Dock Street home, partially obscured by gray clouds, casting strange shadows across the counter where I always prepared breakfast for us both. I stirred sugar into my cup when I felt that creeping disquiet in my chest - a silent warning without name or logical explanation. Ethan was still asleep, and I stood there in my nightgown and slippers, listening to the heavy silence of our apartment while the salt air drifted in from the Cape Fear River.

I took a deep breath trying to dismiss that silly feeling, but my hand trembled slightly while placing sourdough in the toaster. It was just another ordinary Friday, I told myself. Ethan would leave for work as always, return in the evening complaining about Market Street traffic. That's what I kept repeating, even knowing a mother's heart rarely errs when it whispers something isn't right. I'm Maggie. Forty-nine years old, clinical therapist at Coastal Wellness for over twenty years. That morning, preparing our coffee as I had done every day for twenty-one years, I couldn't have known some routines are destined to break forever.

Ethan appeared in the hallway at seven fifteen, hair tousled, still in his pajamas, rubbing his eyes like he had since childhood. Even at twenty-five, an architect at Sullivan Engineering with his own office on Third Street, he still had that boyish way of waking up that melted my heart. He mumbled good morning, heading straight for the refrigerator for orange juice. I commented on the gloomy day. He glanced out the window, analyzing the heavy sky, asking if it was raining. When I said no, he assured me it would clear up, pouring juice into a tall glass.

Ethan carried a sweetness that hurt in its purity. At seven, when I'd return exhausted from the clinic, he'd have placed my slippers by the bed and left water on the nightstand - small gestures revealing an immense heart. Now a grown man, he still kept that caring essence, asking daily if I'd taken my medicine. I suggested he take a rideshare today, but he sighed with that patient tone, telling me his Ninja was serviced, he drove well, and it wasn't even raining.

The famous Ninja. Ethan had bought that black motorcycle like someone buying a realized dream. For him, it meant freedom, the feeling he could go anywhere, be anything. For me, it was a constant worry masked as maternal pride. He finished breakfast, came to kiss my head. I breathed in his scent - fennel shampoo, subtle cologne, that homey smell that had comforted me for over two decades. I told him to be careful, like every day. He said he'd go slow and let me know when he arrived. We exchanged I love yous.

If I'd known that was our last morning I love you, I would have held that moment longer. Would have better recorded his laughter echoing down the hall when he stumbled trying to put on his sock. Would have paid more attention to how he hung his key on the hook before leaving.
