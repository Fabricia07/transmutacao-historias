FADE IN:

The summer sun blazed over Wrightsville Beach as Ethan Bennett made his way across the warm sand, his blue surfboard tucked under his arm. In the distance, he spotted Joann Adams adjusting the zipper of her wetsuit, her silhouette backlit by the morning light.

The Atlantic waves crashed rhythmically against the shore, creating a perfect backdrop for what promised to be an epic session. The salty breeze carried the familiar scent of the ocean, while seagulls circled overhead against the cloudless North Carolina sky.

FADE OUT.
