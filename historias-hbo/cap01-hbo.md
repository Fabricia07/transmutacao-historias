FADE IN:

The morning sun casts long shadows across Wrightsville Beach as Ethan Bennett waxes his surfboard, his eyes fixed on the promising swells rolling in. Next to him, Joann Adams adjusts her wetsuit, her blonde hair catching the golden light of dawn.

The offshore winds create clean, head-high waves - a perfect day for surfing the North Carolina coast. They paddle out beyond the break, sitting on their boards as pelicans glide overhead.

"This reminds me of that summer in California," Joann says, watching the horizon.

Ethan nods, a slight smile crossing his face. "Different coast, same feeling."

A set approaches. They turn their boards, paddling in sync with the building wave. Ethan drops in first, carving a smooth bottom turn while Joann catches the wave behind him, her silhouette framed against the rising sun.

They spend the morning trading waves, their movements becoming one with the ocean's rhythm. The beach slowly fills with early morning joggers and dog walkers, but out here, it's just them and the Atlantic.

FADE OUT.
