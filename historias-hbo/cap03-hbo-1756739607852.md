FADE IN:

INT. WILMINGTON APARTMENT - KITCHEN - MORNING

The soft morning light of September filters through the kitchen window, partially obscured by storm clouds rolling in from the Atlantic. The drip of the coffee maker provides a steady rhythm that usually brings comfort, but something feels off today.

SARAH (V.O.)
(soft southern accent)
Some mornings just feel different. You can't 
explain it, but you know it deep in your bones.

SARAH MITCHELL (49), a clinical psychologist, stands at her granite countertop in her robe and slippers. She stirs sweetener into her coffee, watching the dark liquid swirl. Behind her, the Port City's skyline is visible through the window.

The apartment is silent except for the coffee maker's dying gurgles and the distant sound of waves. Down the hallway, her husband MICHAEL sleeps soundly.

SARAH (V.O.)
Twenty years of listening to other people's 
intuitions taught me one thing - when something 
feels wrong, it usually is.

She pauses, spoon mid-stir, as an inexplicable unease settles over her. The shadows in the kitchen seem to lengthen despite the brightening day.

FADE OUT.
