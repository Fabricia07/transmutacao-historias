FADE IN:

The summer sun blazed over Wrightsville Beach as Ethan Bennett made his way across the warm sand, his blue surfboard tucked under his arm. The morning light painted long shadows across the beach when he spotted Joann Adams adjusting her wetsuit near the shoreline.

Their silhouettes stood out against the golden horizon, a perfect East Coast morning for catching waves. The ocean breeze carried the salt spray as they exchanged knowing glances, ready to take on the Atlantic swells.

FADE OUT.
