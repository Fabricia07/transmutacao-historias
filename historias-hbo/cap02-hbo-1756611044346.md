FADE IN:

The summer sun blazes over Wrightsville Beach as waves crash against the North Carolina shore. Ethan Bennett walks across the sand, his blue surfboard tucked under his arm, salt air filling his lungs. He spots Joann Adams near the water's edge, adjusting the zipper of her wetsuit with practiced precision.

The morning light creates a cinematic glow around them, the ocean a backdrop of endless possibilities. Their silhouettes stand out against the golden horizon, two figures ready to challenge the Atlantic swells.

FADE OUT.
