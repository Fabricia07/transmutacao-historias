FADE IN:

INT. WILMINGTON APARTMENT KITCHEN - EARLY MORNING

Coffee drips steadily in a worn Mr. Coffee maker, the familiar sound that usually marks the start of another coastal morning. But something about the rhythm feels off today.

Through the kitchen window, August sunlight struggles through heavy storm clouds rolling in from the Cape Fear River, casting unusual shadows across the granite countertop where SARAH (49), a clinical psychologist, stands in her robe and house slippers.

She stirs Splenda into her coffee mug, an uneasy feeling creeping through her chest. Her husband DAVID sleeps in the next room. The silence in their River Place apartment feels thick, heavy with something unspoken.

SARAH (V.O.)
Twenty years of helping others navigate their darkest thoughts, yet this morning, my own mind won't settle.

She pauses, spoon suspended mid-stir, listening to the distant sound of foghorns from passing ships.

SARAH (V.O.)
(continuing)
Two decades of practice on Market Street, and I've never felt quite like this.

The coffee maker sputters its final drops.

FADE OUT.
