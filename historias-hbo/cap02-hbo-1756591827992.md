FADE IN:

The morning sun blazed over Wrightsville Beach, casting long shadows across the pristine North Carolina shore. Ethan Bennett walked across the sand, his blue surfboard tucked under his arm, the salt air filling his lungs with each step.

He spotted Joann Adams near the waterline, adjusting the zipper of her wetsuit with practiced precision. The Atlantic waves crashed rhythmically behind her, promising a perfect session ahead.

FADE OUT.
