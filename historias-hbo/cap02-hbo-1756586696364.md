FADE IN:

The summer sun blazed over Wrightsville Beach as Ethan Bennett and Joann Adams crossed paths on the warm Carolina sand. The ocean breeze tousled Joann's hair while she adjusted the zipper of her sleek wetsuit. Ethan's weathered blue surfboard reflected the morning light, carrying the battle scars of countless sessions.

The rhythmic sound of breaking waves provided a natural soundtrack to their meeting, as seagulls circled overhead against the crystalline sky. Their silhouettes stood out against the golden morning haze, two figures united by their love for the ocean.

FADE OUT.
