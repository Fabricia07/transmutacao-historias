Coffee dripped into the pot with that familiar sound marking the start of our days, but something about the rhythm of those drops left me unsettled that Friday morning. March light filtered through the kitchen window of our Dock Street home, partially obscured by gray clouds, casting strange shadows across the counter where I always prepared breakfast for us both. As I stirred sugar into my cup, an unease crept like a shadow in my chest - a silent warning without name or logical explanation. Ethan was still asleep, and I stood there in my nightgown and slippers, listening to the heavy silence of our downtown apartment. The distant sound of early morning traffic on Market Street barely registered through our old windows.

I took a deep breath trying to dismiss that foolish feeling, but my hand trembled slightly while placing French bread in the toaster. It was just another ordinary Friday, I told myself. Ethan would leave for work as always, return in the evening complaining about Historic District traffic. That's what I kept repeating, even knowing a mother's heart rarely errs when it whispers something isn't right. I'm Maggie. Forty-nine years old, clinical therapist at Coastal Wellness for over twenty years. That morning, preparing our coffee as I had done every day for twenty-one years, I couldn't imagine some routines are destined to break forever.

Ethan appeared in the hallway at seven fifteen, hair tousled, still in pajamas, rubbing his eyes like he had since childhood. Even at twenty-five, an architect with his own office at Sullivan Engineering, he still had that boyish way of waking up that melted my heart. He mumbled good morning, heading straight for the refrigerator for orange juice. I commented on the gloomy day. He glanced through the window, analyzing the heavy sky, asking if it was raining. When I said no, he assured me with gentle confidence the weather would clear up.

Ethan carried a sweetness that hurt in its purity. At seven, when I'd return exhausted from the clinic, he'd have laid out my slippers beside the bed and left water on the nightstand - small gestures revealing an immense heart. Now a grown man, he still kept that caring essence, asking daily if I'd taken my medications.

I suggested he take a rideshare today while he buttered his bread. He sighed with patient tolerance, assuring me his motorcycle was serviced, he drove well, and it wasn't even raining. The famous black sport bike. Ethan had bought it like someone purchasing a realized dream. For him, it meant freedom, the feeling he could go anywhere, be anything. For me, it was a constant worry masked as maternal pride.

He finished breakfast, came to kiss my head. I breathed in his scent - fennel shampoo, subtle cologne, that homey smell that had comforted me for over two decades. I told him to be careful, as I did every day. He promised to drive slowly and let me know when he arrived, saying he loved me. I said it back.

If I'd known that would be our last morning I love you, I would have held that moment longer. Would have better recorded his laughter echoing down the hall when he stumbled trying to put on his sock. Would have paid more attention to how he hung his key on the hook before leaving.
