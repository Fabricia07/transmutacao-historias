FADE IN:

INT. WILMINGTON APARTMENT - KITCHEN - MORNING

The soft whir of a Keurig machine fills the quiet kitchen as dawn breaks over the Cape Fear River. SARAH (49), a clinical psychologist, stands in her robe and slippers, watching the coffee drip with unusual attention.

The April morning light filters through heavy clouds, casting peculiar shadows across the granite countertop where she normally prepares breakfast for two. Spanish moss sways outside the window, adding to the morning's eerie quality.

Sarah stirs Splenda into her coffee, an inexplicable unease settling in her chest. From down the hall, MARK's gentle snoring carries through their modest apartment near Historic Downtown.

SARAH (V.O.)
(soft, contemplative)
Twenty years of helping others understand their anxieties, yet here I am, unsettled by the rhythm of my own morning routine.

She stands motionless, the harbor's distant fog horns punctuating the heavy silence.

FADE OUT.
