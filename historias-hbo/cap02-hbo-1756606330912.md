FADE IN:

The summer sun blazed over Wrightsville Beach as Ethan Bennett made his way across the warm sand, his blue surfboard tucked under his arm. In the distance, he spotted Joann Adams adjusting the zipper of her wetsuit, her silhouette backlit by the shimmering Atlantic waters.

The morning light cast long shadows across the beach, giving the scene an almost ethereal quality. Salt spray hung in the air as waves crashed rhythmically against the shore, their sound mixing with distant seagull calls.

Joann's wetsuit glistened with droplets of water from her earlier warm-up swim, while Ethan's board reflected the morning light like a piece of the sky itself.

FADE OUT.
