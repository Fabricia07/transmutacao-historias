FADE IN:

INT. WILMINGTON APARTMENT - KITCHEN - EARLY MORNING

The first light of September filters through plantation shutters, casting long shadows across a modern coastal kitchen. Heavy clouds threaten another late summer storm.

The steady drip of a coffee maker provides the only soundtrack to this Friday morning. SARAH (49), a clinical psychologist, stands barefoot in her cotton robe, watching the coffee brew. Something about the rhythm feels off today.

She absently stirs Sweet'N Low into her coastal-themed mug, her mind elsewhere. The weight of the morning sits heavy on her shoulders.

SARAH (V.O.)
Twenty years of helping others through their darkest moments, yet some mornings... some mornings just feel different.

Through the kitchen doorway, down the hallway of their River Place apartment, JAMES still sleeps. The distant sound of the Cape Fear River's morning traffic drifts up seven stories.

Sarah remains frozen by the coffee maker, the familiar comfort of her morning routine suddenly feeling foreign.

SARAH (V.O.)
I've called Wilmington home for two decades now. Built my practice here. Built a life here. But today...

She glances at the wall clock: 6:47 AM. The clouds outside grow darker.

FADE OUT.
