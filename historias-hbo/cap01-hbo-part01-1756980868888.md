The coffee maker's steady drip echoes through my kitchen on Dock Street, each drop marking time like a metronome counting down moments I didn't know were precious. March sunlight filters weakly through storm clouds, casting unfamiliar shadows across my granite countertop where I've prepared our breakfast ritual for twenty-one years. The spoon clinks against porcelain as I stir sugar into my coffee, but something feels off – a shadow of unease crawling through my chest that I can't explain or dismiss.

My son Ethan is still asleep upstairs. I stand motionless in my robe and slippers, listening to the heavy silence of our historic downtown home. The hardwood floors creak slightly under my weight as I shift, trying to shake this nameless dread. My hand trembles while sliding sourdough into the toaster. Just another Friday, I tell myself. Ethan will head to Sullivan Engineering like always, then come home complaining about Market Street traffic.

I'm Maggie Bennett, forty-nine, a clinical therapist for over two decades. Standing here in my kitchen, preparing breakfast as I have every morning since Ethan was four, I had no way of knowing some routines are destined to shatter forever.

At seven-fifteen, I hear familiar footsteps in the hallway. Ethan appears, hair tousled from sleep, still in his pajamas, rubbing his eyes just like he did as a little boy. Even at twenty-five, a successful architect with his own office on Third Street, he carries that same boyish charm that melts my heart. The refrigerator door opens with a soft whoosh as he reaches for the orange juice.

Morning, Mom, he murmurs, voice still rough with sleep. I mention the gloomy weather, and he pauses to study the heavy clouds through our kitchen window overlooking the Cape Fear River. He asks if it's raining, and when I say no, he dismisses my concern with gentle confidence. The juice splashes into his favorite tall glass, the one with the chip on the rim that he refuses to replace.

My Ethan, with his impossibly pure heart. At seven, he'd leave my slippers by the bed when I came home exhausted from the clinic, a glass of water on my nightstand – small gestures from an enormous soul. Now grown, he still carries that careful nature, checking daily if I've taken my medication.

The butter knife scrapes against toast as he prepares his breakfast. I suggest using a rideshare service today, but he gives me that patient look I know so well. He assures me his motorcycle is well-maintained, reminds me he's a careful driver, points out again the lack of rain. That sleek black machine – his pride and joy, his symbol of freedom. My constant worry disguised as maternal pride.

The kitchen fills with the scent of his familiar shampoo as he leans down to kiss my head goodbye. Anise and something uniquely him, a scent that's meant home and safety for over two decades. Be safe, I tell him, like every morning. He promises to text when he arrives, says he loves me. I love you too, I reply, the words falling easily from my lips.

If I'd known it was our last morning exchange of those three words, I would have held onto that moment longer. Would have memorized the sound of his laughter echoing off the foyer walls when he stumbled putting on his socks. Would have watched more carefully how he hung his keys on the hook by the door, the metal catching the dim morning light one final time.
