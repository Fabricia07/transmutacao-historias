FADE IN:

INT. WILMINGTON APARTMENT - KITCHEN - EARLY MORNING

The soft DRIP of a coffee maker echoes through a modest kitchen overlooking the Cape Fear River. Morning light filters through heavy July clouds, casting unusual shadows across granite countertops.

SARAH (V.O.)
(soft, contemplative)
Some mornings just feel...different.

SARAH MATTHEWS (49), wearing a light cotton robe and house slippers, stands motionless by the coffee maker. Her hand hovers over her mug, sugar spoon suspended mid-stir.

The apartment sits in heavy silence, broken only by the rhythmic dripping and distant foghorns from the river.

SARAH (V.O.)
Twenty years as a clinical psychologist 
teaches you to trust your instincts. 
This morning, something's off.

Through the kitchen doorway, we glimpse a hallway leading to a bedroom where DANIEL (51) sleeps soundly.

Sarah's gaze drifts to the window, where Spanish moss sways from live oaks in the humid morning air.

SARAH (V.O.)
The weight in my chest... it's like 
the calm before a Carolina storm.

She places both hands on the counter, letting the coffee grow cold.

FADE OUT.
