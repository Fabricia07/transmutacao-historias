FADE IN:

The summer sun blazes over Wrightsville Beach, casting long shadows across the pristine North Carolina coastline. Ethan Bennett makes his way through the morning crowd, his blue surfboard tucked under his arm, salt air filling his lungs.

Through the golden haze, he spots Joann Adams adjusting the zipper of her wetsuit, her fingers working methodically against the black neoprene. Their eyes meet as the Atlantic waves crash rhythmically behind them.

FADE OUT.
