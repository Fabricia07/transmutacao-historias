The coffee dripped steadily in the maker with that familiar sound that always marked the start of our days, but something about the rhythm of those drops left me unsettled that Friday morning. March light filtered through the kitchen window of our Dock Street home, partially obscured by gray clouds, casting strange shadows across the counter where I always prepared breakfast for us both. I stirred sugar into my cup when I felt an unease crawling like a shadow in my chest - a silent warning with no name or logical explanation. Ethan was still sleeping, and I stood there in my nightgown and slippers, listening to the heavy silence of our apartment. I took a deep breath trying to dismiss that silly feeling, but my hand trembled slightly while placing French bread in the toaster. It was just another ordinary Friday, Ethan would leave for work as always, return in the evening complaining about traffic. That's what I kept telling myself, even knowing a mother's heart rarely errs when it whispers something isn't right.

I'm Maggie. Forty-nine years old, clinical therapist at Coastal Wellness for over twenty years. That morning, preparing our coffee as I had done every day for twenty-one years, I couldn't imagine some routines are destined to break forever. Ethan appeared in the hallway at seven fifteen, hair tousled, still in his pajamas, rubbing his eyes like he'd done since childhood. Even at twenty-five, an architect at Sullivan Engineering, he still had that boyish way of waking up that melted my heart.

He mumbled good morning, heading straight for the refrigerator in search of orange juice. I mentioned how gloomy the day looked. He glanced out the window, analyzing the heavy sky, asking if it was raining. When I said no, he assured me it would clear up, pouring juice into a tall glass.

Ethan carried a sweetness that hurt in its purity. At seven, when I'd return exhausted from the clinic, he'd have set my slippers beside the bed and left a glass of water on the nightstand - small gestures revealing an immense heart. Now a grown man, he still kept that caring essence, asking daily if I'd taken my medications.

I suggested he take a rideshare today, while he buttered his bread. He sighed with that patient tone, telling me his Ninja was serviced, he drove well, and it wasn't even raining. To stop worrying needlessly. The famous Ninja. Ethan had bought that black motorcycle like someone buying a realized dream. For him, it meant freedom, the feeling he could go anywhere, be anything. For me, it was a constant source of worry disguised as maternal pride.

He finished breakfast, came to kiss my head. I breathed in his scent - fennel shampoo, subtle cologne, that homey smell that had comforted me for over two decades. I told him to be careful, as I did every day. He said he'd go slow and let me know when he arrived. We exchanged I love yous.

If I'd known that would be our last morning I love you, I would have held that moment longer. Would have better recorded his laughter echoing down the hall when he tripped on his own foot trying to put on his sock. Would have paid more attention to how he hung his key on the hook before leaving.
