The coffee maker's gentle gurgle echoes through our Dock Street kitchen, a rhythm that's marked our mornings for twenty-one years. But today, something in that familiar pattern sends a chill down my spine. March light filters through storm clouds, casting strange shadows across our granite countertop where I'm preparing breakfast, just like always.

I stir sugar into my Port City Java mug, the spoon making soft circles against ceramic. That's when I feel it - a shadow of unease creeping through my chest, the kind of wordless warning that defies logic but demands attention. My son Ethan is still asleep upstairs, and I stand frozen in my robe and slippers, listening to the heavy silence of our historic downtown apartment. The old hardwood floors creak slightly under my weight as I shift, trying to shake off this foolish anxiety.

My hand trembles slightly as I slide sourdough into the toaster. Just another Friday, I tell myself. Ethan will head to Sullivan Engineering like always, then come home tonight complaining about Market Street traffic. But my heart - a mother's heart - whispers otherwise. I'm Maggie, forty-nine, a therapist at Coastal Wellness for over two decades. Standing here in our sun-dappled kitchen, preparing breakfast like I have every morning since Ethan was four, I couldn't know some routines are destined to shatter forever.

At seven-fifteen, Ethan appears in the hallway, hair tousled, still in his sleep clothes, rubbing his eyes just like he did as a little boy. Even at twenty-five, a licensed architect with his own office at Sullivan Engineering, he still has that sleepy-boy charm that melts my heart. He mumbles good morning, heading straight for the refrigerator and his morning orange juice.

The overcast sky catches his attention when I mention the gloomy weather. He studies the heavy clouds through our kitchen window overlooking the Cape Fear River. Is it raining, he asks. When I say no, but... he cuts me off with gentle reassurance, his voice warm like honey as he pours juice into a tall glass. The weather will clear, he says, don't worry.

Ethan has always had this pure sweetness that aches to witness. At seven, he'd leave my slippers by the bed when I came home exhausted from the clinic, a glass of water on my nightstand - tiny gestures from an enormous heart. Now grown, he still carries that thoughtful nature, checking daily if I've taken my medications.

The familiar scent of his fennel shampoo and light cologne wraps around me as he kisses the top of my head goodbye. That smell of home, of twenty-five years of love and morning routines. Be safe, I say, like every day before. He promises to drive carefully and text when he arrives. I love you, he calls over his shoulder.

I love you too, I reply, not knowing it's our last morning exchange. If I'd known, I would have held onto that moment longer. Would have memorized the sound of his laugh echoing down the hallway when he stumbled putting on socks. Would have watched more carefully how he hung his keys on the hook by the door one final time, the metal catching that gray morning light.
