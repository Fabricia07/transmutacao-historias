FADE IN:

The summer sun blazes over Wrightsville Beach, casting long shadows across the pristine North Carolina coastline. Ethan Bennett walks across the sand, his blue surfboard tucked under his arm, the morning light gleaming off its polished surface.

He spots Joann Adams near the waterline, adjusting the zipper of her black wetsuit with practiced precision. The Atlantic waves crash rhythmically behind her, creating a hypnotic backdrop to their morning ritual.

FADE OUT.
