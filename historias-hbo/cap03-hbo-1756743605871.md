FADE IN:

INT. 847 DOCK STREET APARTMENT - KITCHEN - MORNING

The March light filters through gray clouds, casting strange shadows across the granite countertop of a Historic Downtown kitchen. Outside, the Cape Fear River is barely visible through a coastal mist.

The familiar drip of a Port City Java house blend echoes through the silence. MAGGIE BENNETT (49), a clinical therapist, stands in her silk robe and slippers, stirring cream into her coffee. Something about the rhythm of the drops feels off, creating an unsettling dissonance.

She pauses, spoon suspended mid-stir. The morning stillness feels heavy, weighted with something she can't name. Down the hallway, ETHAN (25) sleeps in their bedroom, his running shoes still by the door from yesterday's jog along the Riverwalk.

Maggie's hand trembles slightly as she sets the spoon down. The coastal chill seeps through the windows, and she wraps her fingers around the warm mug, seeking comfort.

Through the kitchen window, she watches as the first hints of golden coastal light try to break through the cloud cover. A gull CRIES somewhere near the river, the sound sharp and lonely in the dawn quiet.

She takes a sip, but the coffee tastes wrong somehow. Different. Like everything else this morning, it carries an undertone of warning she can't quite decode.

CLOSE ON Maggie's face as she stares into the middle distance, her therapist's intuition picking up signals her conscious mind hasn't processed yet.

The coffee maker gives one final DRIP.

FADE OUT.
