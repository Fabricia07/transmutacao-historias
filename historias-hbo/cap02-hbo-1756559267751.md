FADE IN:

The morning sun cast a golden glow over Wrightsville Beach as Ethan Bennett made his way across the warm sand, his blue surfboard tucked under his arm. The ocean breeze carried the familiar scent of salt and sunscreen through the air.

In the distance, he spotted Joann Adams adjusting the zipper of her wetsuit, her silhouette backlit by the rising summer sun. The waves crashed rhythmically against the shore, promising a perfect session ahead.

FADE OUT.
