FADE IN:

INT. WILMINGTON APARTMENT - KITCHEN - EARLY MORNING

The soft drip of a coffee maker echoes through a modest kitchen overlooking the Cape Fear River. Gray October clouds cast a murky light through the window.

SARAH (V.O.)
(soft, contemplative)
Some mornings just feel different. You wake up and something's off, even if you can't name it.

SARAH MITCHELL (49), wearing a faded UNC Wilmington sweatshirt and slippers, stands at the counter stirring sugar into her coffee. Her movements are mechanical, distracted. The kitchen shows signs of a comfortable routine - two mugs set out, yesterday's Wilmington Star-News folded on the table.

Through the doorway, we can see into a darkened hallway leading to the bedroom where DAVID still sleeps.

SARAH (V.O.)
Twenty years as a therapist teaches you to trust these feelings. The ones that crawl up your spine and nest somewhere behind your ribs.

She stops stirring, listening to the heavy silence broken only by the distant sound of early morning traffic on Market Street.

SARAH (V.O.)
My patients tell me I'm good at reading people. But sometimes the hardest person to read is yourself.

She wraps her hands around the warm mug, staring out at the gray morning.

FADE OUT.
