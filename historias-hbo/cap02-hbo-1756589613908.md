FADE IN:

The summer sun blazed over Wrightsville Beach as Ethan Bennett made his way across the warm sand, his blue surfboard tucked under his arm. In the distance, he spotted Joann Adams adjusting the zipper of her wetsuit, her silhouette backlit by the glinting Atlantic waves.

The morning light cast long shadows across the beach as they met, exchanging knowing glances that spoke of the perfect sets rolling in. The salt air clung to their skin, a familiar embrace that marked the beginning of another session in the water.

FADE OUT.
