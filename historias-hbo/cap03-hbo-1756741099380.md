FADE IN:

INT. WILMINGTON APARTMENT KITCHEN - MORNING

The September sun struggles through heavy clouds, casting strange shadows across a modern coastal kitchen. The coffee maker drips with a familiar rhythm that's somehow off-beat this morning.

SARAH (V.O.)
(soft southern accent)
Something feels different today. Wrong.

SARAH MITCHELL (49), a clinical psychologist, stands barefoot in her nightgown by the counter. Her hand absently stirs sugar into her coffee as she stares out the window at the gathering storm clouds over the Cape Fear River.

The apartment sits in heavy silence, broken only by the irregular drip of coffee and distant seagulls.

SARAH (V.O.)
Twenty years of listening to other 
people's troubles, and now my own 
intuition won't let me rest.

She glances down the hallway where DAVID (51) still sleeps, then back to her coffee cup, watching the liquid swirl into a small whirlpool.

Thunder rumbles in the distance. The morning shadows deepen.

FADE OUT.
