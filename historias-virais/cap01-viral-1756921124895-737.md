T√çTULO: The Last Morning Routine: A Mother's Haunting Premonition

HOOK 15s:
That Friday morning, as I made our usual coffee, something felt terribly wrong. I couldn't know it would be our final breakfast together. My son's motorcycle keys would never hang on that hook again.

HIST√ìRIA:
The coffee dripped into the pot with that familiar sound that always marked the beginning of our days, but something about the rhythm of those drops left me unsettled that Friday morning. As a clinical therapist for twenty years, I should have trusted my instincts more when that shadow of unease crept into my chest. My son Ethan, 25, an architect with a boyish charm that never faded, appeared for breakfast as usual. Despite my subtle plea to take a rideshare, he chose his beloved black motorcycle. Our final 'I love you' exchanged, his keys hung one last time on the hook - a routine destined to break forever. If I'd known it was our last morning together, I would have held that moment longer, memorized his laughter as he stumbled putting on his sock, breathed in his fennel shampoo scent one more time. Sometimes a mother's heart knows before the mind can accept what's coming.

PREVIEW:
A mother's intuition whispers danger on an ordinary Friday morning as she prepares breakfast for her son. Despite the unsettling feeling in her chest, she watches him leave on his motorcycle, not knowing this familiar routine would be their last. A haunting reminder that sometimes our hearts know what our minds refuse to accept. üíî
