HISTÓRIA:
Coffee drips echo through a historic Wilmington townhouse as Maggie Bennett, a 49-year-old therapist, feels an inexplicable unease on a foggy March morning. Her husband Ethan's leather bracelet lies abandoned on the counter - something he never removes. The morning feels wrong as coastal mist rises from the Cape Fear River, and memories flood through framed photos on their Dock Street home's walls. After a late night discussing his engineering project with colleague Julian, Ethan remains unusually quiet upstairs. As Maggie stands alone in her kitchen, the familiar sounds of their home take on an ominous tone, leading her toward the stairs and a morning that will change everything.
