TÍTULO: Heartbreaking: Mom's Last Breakfast With Son Becomes Life-Changing Tragedy

HOOK 15s:
My hands trembled making his favorite breakfast. Something felt wrong that March morning. After 21 years of our routine, I couldn't shake this dread. I didn't know it would be our final goodbye.

HISTÓRIA:
The coffee maker dripped steadily as I prepared our morning ritual, a shadow of unease crawling through my chest. As a therapist for twenty years, I should have trusted my instincts more that gloomy March morning.

Ethan appeared at seven-fifteen, still boyish at twenty-five, reaching for his chipped glass. The familiar scent of his shampoo filled our kitchen as we moved through our practiced dance of breakfast preparation. My protests about his motorcycle were met with his usual gentle reassurance.

If I'd known it was our last morning together, I would have memorized everything: the sound of his laughter echoing off the walls, the way he stumbled putting on his socks, how his keys caught the dim light one final time. His last 'I love you' hangs in the air of our Dock Street home, a precious echo I can never reclaim.

Now I stand in this kitchen alone, the coffee maker still dripping, marking time in a world without my son's morning routine. That nameless dread became my new reality, transforming our breakfast ritual into a bittersweet memory of our final moments together.

PREVIEW:
A mother's intuition screams danger on an ordinary March morning as she prepares breakfast with her architect son. Their twenty-one-year ritual of shared mornings and gentle banter takes a devastating turn, transforming their last 'I love you' into words that would haunt her forever. A heartbreaking story of loss and maternal instinct.
