TÍTULO: The Weight of Silence: A Wilmington Morning

HOOK 15s:
A psychologist's morning coffee ritual turns eerie when her 20 years of clinical intuition warns her something's terribly wrong. But what?

HISTÓRIA:
In a quiet Wilmington apartment overlooking the Cape Fear River, Sarah Matthews stands frozen by her coffee maker. The 49-year-old psychologist can't shake the feeling that something's terribly wrong. Twenty years of clinical experience has taught her to trust these instincts. As foghorns echo across the water and Spanish moss sways in the humid morning air, she watches her coffee grow cold, her husband Daniel sleeping peacefully in the next room. The weight in her chest grows heavier - like the calm before a Carolina storm.

PREVIEW:
A seasoned psychologist's morning routine is disrupted by an inexplicable sense of dread. As fog rolls in from the Cape Fear River and her coffee grows cold, Sarah Matthews can't shake the feeling that this morning is different. After 20 years of reading others, her instincts are screaming. But why? #WilmingtonNoir
