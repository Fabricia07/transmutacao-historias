TÍTULO: A Mother's Last Morning With Her Son: The Breakfast That Changed Everything

HOOK 15s:
That Friday morning, as I made coffee like any other day, something felt wrong. I didn't know it would be the last breakfast I'd share with my son Ethan.

HISTÓRIA:
The coffee dripped steadily in the maker with that familiar sound that always marked the beginning of our days, but something about the rhythm of those drops left me unsettled that Friday morning. I'm Maggie, a 49-year-old therapist, and that day started like any other - making breakfast for my son Ethan, 25, an architect who still lived with me. He appeared at 7:15, tousled hair and boyish charm intact, heading straight for his orange juice. Despite my unexplainable unease and suggestion to take a rideshare, he insisted on taking his beloved Ninja motorcycle. He kissed my head goodbye, promised to drive safely, and said 'I love you.' If I'd known it was our last morning together, I would have held that moment longer, memorized his laughter as he stumbled putting on his socks, paid more attention to how he hung his key on the hook before leaving forever.

PREVIEW:
As a mother, my heart whispered something wasn't right that Friday morning. Making coffee for my son Ethan felt different, heavier. I couldn't know it would be our last breakfast together. He took his motorcycle despite my concerns, kissed me goodbye, and said 'I love you' one final time. Some routines are destined to break forever...
