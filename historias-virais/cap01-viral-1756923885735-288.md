T√çTULO: The Last Breakfast: A Mother's Haunting Premonition

HOOK 15s:
That morning, my coffee dripped differently. My son kissed me goodbye like always. I didn't know it would be our last breakfast together. A mother's intuition never lies. üíî

HIST√ìRIA:
Coffee dripped into the pot with an unsettling rhythm that Friday morning. As a therapist for 20 years, I should've trusted my instincts more when that shadow of unease crept into my chest. My son Ethan, 25, appeared for breakfast like always - tousled hair, searching for orange juice, planning to ride his beloved Ninja motorcycle to work.

His laughter echoed down the hallway one final time as he tripped putting on his sock. If only I'd held that moment longer, memorized his scent of fennel shampoo and home, kept him from riding that motorcycle. A mother's heart rarely errs when it whispers something isn't right.

PREVIEW:
The morning started like any other - coffee brewing, toast in the toaster, a mother preparing breakfast for her son. But something felt different.

If only I'd known it was our last breakfast together...
