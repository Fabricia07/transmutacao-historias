After 20 years of helping others navigate their lives, her intuition has never failed her. But today, as storm clouds roll in from the Atlantic and unusual shadows dance across her granite countertop, something feels deeply wrong. While her husband David sleeps peacefully in the next room, Sarah remains frozen, stirring Splenda into her coffee as a cargo ship's horn echoes from the Cape Fear River. The familiar morning sounds only amplify the unsettling feeling in her chest. What does this experienced therapist sense coming?
