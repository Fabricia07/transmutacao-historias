TÍTULO: Heartbreaking: Mom's Last Breakfast With Son Ends In Devastating Goodbye

HOOK 15s:
My hands trembled making his toast that morning. Something felt wrong in our familiar routine. The storm clouds cast strange shadows. I couldn't know it would be our final breakfast together.

HISTÓRIA:
The coffee maker's gentle gurgle echoes through our Dock Street kitchen, a rhythm that's marked our mornings for twenty-one years. Today, an inexplicable unease creeps through my chest as I prepare breakfast, trying to ignore the strange shadows cast by storm clouds.

Ethan appears at seven-fifteen, still carrying that sleepy-boy charm at twenty-five. He's always been thoughtful - from leaving slippers by my bed when he was seven, to checking my medications now. The familiar scent of his fennel shampoo and cologne surrounds me as he moves through our morning routine.

He reassures me about the gloomy weather, his voice warm like honey as he pours juice. We exchange our usual goodbye - my cautionary 'be safe,' his promise to text when he arrives, our 'I love yous' echoing in the hallway. He hangs his keys by the door one last time, metal catching the gray morning light.

If I'd known it was our final morning together, I would have held each moment longer - memorized his laugh when he stumbled putting on socks, watched more carefully as he went through our familiar rituals one last time.

PREVIEW:
Standing in our sun-dappled kitchen, preparing breakfast like every morning since my son was four, I couldn't know some routines are destined to shatter. That familiar scent of his shampoo, his sleepy-boy charm at twenty-five, our final 'I love you' - if only I'd known to hold those moments longer.
