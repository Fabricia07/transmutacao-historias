TÍTULO: Heartbreaking: Mom's Last Coffee With Son Becomes Life-Changing Goodbye

HOOK 15s:
That Friday morning, my hands trembled making his coffee. A mother's instinct screamed something wasn't right. My son Ethan kissed my head before leaving on his motorcycle. I never imagined it would be our final breakfast.

HISTÓRIA:
Coffee dripped into the pot that Friday morning, each drop echoing an unexplainable unease in my chest. As a therapist for twenty years, I'd learned to trust instincts, yet I tried dismissing the shadow of dread while preparing our usual breakfast.

Ethan appeared at 7:15, still boyish at twenty-five, heading straight for orange juice as he had since childhood. His gentle presence filled our downtown apartment - the architect son who still laid out my slippers and checked on my medications. The weather was gloomy, but he assured me with characteristic sweetness it would clear.

When he insisted on taking his beloved black motorcycle despite my suggestion for a rideshare, my heart clenched. That bike represented his freedom, his dreams, while embodying my constant worry. He finished breakfast, kissed my head, promised to drive carefully. His familiar scent of fennel shampoo and subtle cologne wrapped around me as he said 'I love you.'

If only I'd known those would be our final moments - his laughter echoing down the hall as he stumbled with his sock, the casual way he hung his keys, our last shared 'I love you.' Some routines aren't meant to last forever, no matter how precious they seem.

PREVIEW:
A mother's intuition whispered danger that gloomy March morning as I made breakfast for my 25-year-old son. Despite my protests, Ethan took his motorcycle to work, kissing my head goodbye. His laughter echoed down the hall one last time - if only I'd known our morning coffee routine would end forever that day.
