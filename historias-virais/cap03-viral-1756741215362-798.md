HOOK 15s:
After 20 years of reading others' minds, therapist Sarah Mitchell wakes up to a morning that feels different. But what happens when your professional intuition turns personal?

HISTÓRIA:
In a modest Wilmington apartment overlooking the Cape Fear River, therapist Sarah Mitchell (49) follows her morning routine, making coffee as October clouds cast murky shadows. Despite two decades of helping others understand their feelings, something feels off today. As she stands in her kitchen, wearing her old UNC Wilmington sweatshirt, the familiar comfort of her daily ritual - two mugs, yesterday's newspaper, David still asleep down the hall - feels suddenly foreign. Her professional instincts are screaming, but for once, she can't read her own signals. The silence of the morning holds a weight she's never felt before.
