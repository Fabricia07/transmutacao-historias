HOOK 15s:
Saw her alone on beach[1s]...perfect waves rolling in[4s]...she didn't know I was watching[8s]...what happened next shocked us both[13s]

HISTÓRIA:
The summer sun hadn't risen yet when I spotted Joann's silhouette against the pre-dawn waves. As an experienced surfer, I knew these were perfect conditions - but seeing her there changed everything. We locked eyes as I approached, both knowing these were once-in-a-lifetime sets. What started as two strangers sharing waves turned into an unforgettable session as we rode the best swells of the season together, pushing each other to catch bigger waves until sunset. Sometimes the best stories start before sunrise.

PREVIEW:
When I saw her surfing alone at 5AM, I knew I had to paddle out. Perfect waves were rolling in and she had no idea I was watching. What happened next on Wrightsville Beach would change both our lives forever...
