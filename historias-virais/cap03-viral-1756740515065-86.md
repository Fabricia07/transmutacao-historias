HIST√ìRIA:
The soft whir of a Keurig machine fills the quiet kitchen as dawn breaks over the Cape Fear River. Sarah, a 49-year-old clinical psychologist, stands frozen in her robe, watching coffee drip with unusual intensity. The April morning light filters eerily through heavy clouds while Spanish moss sways outside, casting strange shadows across her granite countertop. Her husband Mark's gentle snoring echoes from their bedroom, but something feels off. After two decades of helping others understand their anxieties, Sarah can't shake this morning's inexplicable sense of dread. The harbor's fog horns cut through the silence, marking a morning that feels like the calm before a storm.
