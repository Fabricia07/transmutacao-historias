TÍTULO: The Last Coffee: A Therapist's Dark Premonition

HOOK 15s:
That morning, the coffee maker's rhythm felt different. As a therapist for 20 years, I knew when something was wrong. I just didn't know it would change everything.

HISTÓRIA:
The coffee dripped steadily in the maker with that familiar sound that always marked the beginning of our days, but something about the rhythm of those drops left me unsettled that Friday morning. March light filtered through the kitchen window of our Dock Street home, partially veiled by gray clouds, casting strange shadows across the counter where I always prepared breakfast for the two of us. As I stirred sugar into my cup, an uneasiness crept like a shadow deep in my chest. Ethan was still asleep upstairs, and I stood there in my nightgown and slippers, absorbing the heavy silence of our Historic Downtown apartment. My name is Maggie Bennett. I'm forty-nine, and I've been a clinical therapist for over twenty years.

PREVIEW:
When the morning coffee sounds wrong, should you trust your instincts? Maggie Bennett, a seasoned therapist, faces an unsettling premonition in her Historic Downtown home. The familiar becomes ominous as March shadows and silence create the perfect storm for what's about to unfold...
