TÍTULO: The Morning Everything Changed: A Psychologist's Dark Awakening 🌅

HOOK 15s:
A seasoned psychologist's morning coffee ritual turns sinister as storm clouds gather over Wilmington. After 20 years of helping others face their demons, she's about to confront her own. What lurks in the shadows of her seemingly perfect life? ☕️🌪️

HISTÓRIA:
Sarah Matthews, a respected 49-year-old psychologist, stands in her Wilmington apartment kitchen making her morning coffee. The familiar ritual feels oddly unsettling today as storm clouds roll in from the Atlantic. Spanish moss sways ominously outside while her husband Michael sleeps peacefully down the hall. Twenty years of professional experience hasn't prepared her for the inexplicable dread creeping in with the dawn. As fog horns echo from the Cape Fear River, something in the air shifts - a premonition that her carefully constructed world is about to shatter. The drip coffee maker's rhythm sounds wrong, like a warning she can't quite decode. 🏠☕️⛈️

PREVIEW:
When your morning coffee ritual of 20 years suddenly feels wrong, do you listen to that voice inside? Sarah Matthews, a veteran psychologist, is about to learn that sometimes the most dangerous demons aren't in our patients' minds - they're brewing right in our own kitchen. ⚡️🌊
