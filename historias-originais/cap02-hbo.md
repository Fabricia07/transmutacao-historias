FADE IN:

The summer sun blazed over Wrightsville Beach as Ethan Bennett made his way across the warm sand, his blue surfboard tucked under his arm. In the distance, he spotted Joann Adams adjusting her wetsuit, her silhouette backlit by the morning light.

The waves crashed rhythmically against the shore, creating a perfect backdrop for what promised to be an epic session. Salt air filled their lungs as they exchanged knowing glances â€“ the kind shared between surfers who understand the call of the ocean.

FADE OUT.
