FADE IN:

The morning sun casts long shadows across Wrightsville Beach as Ethan Bennett waxes his shortboard, salt air filling his lungs. Next to him, Joann Adams stretches, her wetsuit already glistening with the day's first mist.

The waves are clean - chest-high sets rolling in with mechanical precision. Perfect for what they had in mind.

"You ready?" Ethan asks, running his hand through his salt-crusted hair.

Joann nods, grabbing her board. They paddle out together, duck-diving under the incoming swells until they reach the lineup. The water is crystal clear, revealing the sandy bottom below.

They take turns catching waves, Ethan favoring aggressive snaps while Joann flows with more graceful, drawn-out turns. The morning session stretches into early afternoon, their laughter carrying across the water.

Later, they sit on their boards, legs dangling in the cool Atlantic. The coastline stretches endlessly in both directions, high-rises giving way to dunes and sea oats swaying in the offshore breeze.

"Days like this," Joann says, "make everything else disappear."

Ethan just smiles, watching another set approach on the horizon.

FADE OUT.
